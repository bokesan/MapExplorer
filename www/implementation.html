<h2><a name="los">Line-of-Sight algorithm</a></h2>

<p>Line-of-sight is defined in the DDM rules as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Two creatures can see each other if they can trace at least one
unblocked straight line between any part of one creature's space
to any part of the other creature's space. This line is unblocked
if it does not intersect or even touch squares that block line of sight.
</blockquote>
<p>While <em>point-to-point</em> line of sight is easy to solve, <em>area-to-area</em>
line of sight, as used in DDM, is harder. I'm only aware of probabilistic
solutions. These work by randomly or systematically testing lines between the spaces
(using a point-to-point algorithm) until either an unblocked line is found or a
maximum number of tests has been done, in which case there is a certain
(high) probability that no line of sight exists. This is implemented in Map Explorer.</p>

<p>This works and does not seem to miss any lines on the official maps, but
I still find it somewhat unsatisfactory. While general area-to-area line of sight seems
to be hard, the two-dimensional square grid of finite (and usually small) size
used in DDM might allow a better solution.</p>

<p>The LOS computation is currently done in floating-point. It should be converted to use
integer arithmetic. There are two reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accuracy: While FP has potentially high accuracy (53 bits), it is quite hard
  (at least for me) to prove that no precision-related bugs can occur. Much easier
  with integer, where I only have to care about overflow.</li>

  <li>Performance: Desktop CPUs usually have very fast FP units, so converting
     to integer might actually make things slower. However, CPUs for smaller devices
     like PDAs often have no or very slow FP hardware. Since desktop and notebook systems
     are fast enough anyway, converting to integer would be good for a PDA version.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Geometric Objects</h2>

<p>Java contains geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons
in the <code>java.awt</code> and <code>java.awt.geom</code> packages.
These even have methods for testing for intersections. There are two reasons
why I did not use these classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't like these types to be mutable.</li>
<li>Performance: they are slower the my more special-purpose classes, in particular
on the default client VM. Using <code>-server</code> and <code>-XX:CompileThreshold</code>
mostly closes the gap, but many systems don't even have a server VM installed.</li>
</ol>
