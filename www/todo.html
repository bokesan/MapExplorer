<h1>Known Bugs</h1>

<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to place an elemental wall next to a wall.</li>
  <li>When a map file can not be found, the program should show a file
      dialog instead of just an error message. In particular, this applies to
      not finding the starting map (Fane of Lolth) on startup.</li>
</ul>

<h1>TO-DO List</h1>


<h2>Line-of-Sight algorithm</h2>

<p>The LoS algorithm could be improved. See the
 <a href="implementation.html#los">implementation notes</a> for details.</p>

<h2>GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Better map rendering. Should use transparency for some map features
      and generally look better.</li>
  <li>User defineable map features. New features that don't change the way LoS works
      should not require programming.</li>
  <li>A settings or preferences dialog.</li>
  <li>Preferences should be saved in a per-user configuration file.</li>
  <li>Add an about dialog. Should contain a link to the home page.</li>
  <li>Extend Drag and Drop: 
      Dragging out of the map should create a screenshot of the map.</li>
  <li>Provide simpler map selection for the standard maps. The file chooser should only
      be necessary for user-created or -modified maps. Should incorporate the map
      files into the jar to make this foolproof (see <em>internal improvements</em>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mobile device support</h2>

<p>On a tablet pc or UMPC should work as-is. Maybe the user interface could be improved for
touch-screen operation. For smaller devices, such as PDAs or Smartphones, would require
considerable effort.</p>

<h2>Internal improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Incorporate the standard map files into the jar. Would for most purposes remove the
      necessitiy to determine the installation directory.</li>
  <li>Make it possible to run the benchmark and test code from the GUI.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Big Features</h2>

<p>Currently, Map Explorer should really be called LOS Explorer, since that's all it
does. Here is a list of bigger features that might be useful:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Show ranged cover in addition to LoS.</li>
 <li><em>Movement ranges.</em> Depending on creature size and movement type. To be really useful,
 need to be ably to place friendly and opposing creatues on the map, as they affect movement.
 Might show normal and double movement with different colors or icons.
 Movement is not symmetric (because of difficult terrain), so there is a difference
 between moving <em>from</em> a square and moving <em>to</em> a square.
 </li>
 <li><em>Command range.</em></li>
 <li><em>Line targeting.</em></li>

</ul>
