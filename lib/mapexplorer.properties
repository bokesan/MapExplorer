# Property settings for Map Explorer.

# Number of threads to use for the LOS calculation.
# Default is the number of CPUs in your system. There
# is normally no need to change this.
#
# mapexplorer.threads = 10

# Number of random LOS tests per square to use in addition to the
# systematic tests. On the official maps, Map Explorer does not need
# random tests, so this could be set to 0 for a (very minor) speedup.
# I recommend leaving at the default value
#
# mapexplorer.rndtests = 100


# Setting colors:
#   mapexplorer.color.<tag>  = <value>
#
# where <tag> is one of
#  GRID, WALL, LOS, CREATURE
#  DIFFICULT, STATUE, SACRED_CIRCLE, SUMMONING_CIRCLE, SPIKE_STONES,
#  BLOOD_ROCK, HAUNTED, RISKY, PIT, LAVA, SMOKE,
#  START_A, START_B, EXIT_A, EXIT_B, VICTORY_A, VICTORY_B.
#
# and <value> is a color given in hexadecimal RGB or RGBA format:
#   RRGGBB   -  red, green, blue component
#   RRGGBBAA -  red, green, blue, alpha component
#
# For example, transparent blue victory area A:
#   mapexplorer.color.VICTORY_A = 0000ff80
